# make a project folder
mkdir myproject && cd myproject 

# Now create here the virtual environment inside its 
# own folder. Call it venv or env or something obvious:
pyvenv venv

# Put the venv in your .gitignore:
git init
echo '/venv' > .gitignore
# This keeps your virtual environment out of source control.

# Activate the environment:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install something:
pip install numpy

# Freeze the requirements:
pip freeze > requirements.txt

# Check requirements.txt into source control:
git add requirements.txt

# And maybe do somthing like this:
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

"""
The basic idea here is simple. 
Your virtual environment stays 
in its own folder, which you 
don’t check into source control. 
That way your environment does 
not pollute your project’s root. 
The requirements, on the other 
hand, do get checked into source 
control.
